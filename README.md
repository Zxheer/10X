A marketplace connecting programmers looking for jobs with companies looking to statistically find the best ones. Built as a serverless app with React, Redux &amp; Firestore.

## Goal
This was my final year university project. Here’s what I wrote as an intro to my project:
> We help programmers find great companies to work at and help companies find great programmers. We test programmers on their actual coding ability, generating a statistical report on their strengths & weaknesses. This report helps companies quickly assess candidates on objective metrics rather than subjective resumes. Companies can contact, interview and extend offer letters to programmers all through our online platform.
My role in the team was to develop the Mobile App.

## Goal
To run it:
1. Clone the repo
2. In the root directory, from your command line, run `npm start`
3. The app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

The company search screen. From this screen you can filter candidates for your needs. You can also quickly get a sense of how good a candidate is compared to the statistical average. This helps hiring managers make decisions quicker.
